Features
========

* A compact UI when just listing messages.
* Color-coded accounts.

Issues
======

* Untested on Windows, and file paths will probably be a problem.
* Non-utf8 international encodings show up garbled.
* No support yet for sending attachments, or displaying them inline.
* Drafts save, but aren't editable.

Installation
============

Pre-release downloads (there will be bugs):
* [OS X (alpha 2)](https://github.com/elbrook/whitebox/releases/download/alpha2/Whitebox.zip)
* [Linux 64-bit (alpha 1)](https://github.com/elbrook/whitebox/releases/download/alpha1/Whitebox-alpha1-Linux64.zip) â€“ better to use `git clone git://github.com/elbrook/whitebox`
